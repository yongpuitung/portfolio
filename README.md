## Projects
### Using R
1. Data Wrangling Project
   
In this project, I utilize R to preprocess Spotify's "Unpopular Songs" and "Genre of Artists" datasets from Kaggle. Following Hadley Wickham’s “Tidy Data” principles, I have cleaned up all types of messy data to ensure the resulting clean dataset is ready for statistical analysis, ensuring accurate and ethical data practices.

2. Regression Project
   
This project focuses on predictive modeling for sports car prices, leveraging statistical analysis in RStudio. The goal is to develop robust linear regression models that effectively predict sports car prices based on their functional and technical attributes.
